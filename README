# My build of dmenu

This is a repo containing my build of the suckless software dmenu, a useful (and minimalist) menu program which is highly customisable and indispensible in shell scripting. 

## Uses of dmenu

I mainly use dmenu for a series of custom shell scripts I wrote. For example, I have one that allows me to open any pdf stored on my computer with the touch of a few keys. I have another that lets me select my screen layout from a custom list of options. 

## Feel free to use!

You can find the original 'vanilla' version of dmenu at https://tools.suckless.org/dmenu/ as well as a set of available patches.

You can directly clone that repo with the following command:

git clone https://git.suckless.org/dmenu

You are also more than welcome to directly take my own version from here and customise as much as you want.
